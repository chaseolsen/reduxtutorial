Bare minimum application demonstrating the use of React Redux, almost like a boiler plate. It demonstrates stores, reducers, actions, and constants (good practice examples)

Update: I added Redux Devtools (see store/index.js), you can now use the Chrome extension Redux DevTools to view everything regarding Redux in this application through Chrome.
